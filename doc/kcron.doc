== NAME
kcroninit, kcrondestroy - Utilities for getting Kerberos in scheduled jobs or daemons

== SYNOPSIS

*kcroninit* [*-s*]

*kcrondestroy*

== DESCRIPTION

The *kcroninit* utility creates a new principal of the form +username/cron/host.domain@REALM+ and then creates a keytab file that can be used automatically by MIT Kerberos 1.11 (or later) or Heimdal Kerberos 8 (or later).  The kcroninit(1) utility must be run under account +username+ and will prompt to authenticate as +username@REALM+.

The *kcrondestroy* utility destroys the kerberos principal of the form +username/cron/host.domain@REALM+ (created previously via the kcroninit(1) utility) and then removes keytab file that was used for authentication.

After you've run the kcroninit(1) utility Kerberos will begin using this keytab when any current tickets expire.  You can force this behavior by running kdestroy(1) on your ticket cache now.

=== WORKFLOW

Kerberos administrator will first create principal +username/cron/host.domain@REALM+ and provide initial password to the requestor. The requestor can then run +kcroninit+ utility to create the keytab.

Run +kcroninit+ to generate your kcron keytab (in +/var/kerberos/krb5/user/${EUID}/client.keytab+) once your principal exists and you have the required password.  Defaults for +kcroninit+ can be provided in either +/etc/sysconfig/kcron+ or +~/.config/kcron+ if you desire.

When your user/job/daemon requires a Kerberos ticket but does not have one, the Kerberos libraries will automatically import the ticket.
The identity is selected based on either +~/.k5identity+ or +slot 1+ from your kcron keytab (in +/var/kerberos/krb5/user/${EUID}/client.keytab+ following the traditional +kinit -kt+ matching rules).

Runtime usage is automatic if you do not have a valid Kerberos ticket.

Setup your cron job following traditional cron rules.  A +kcron+ prefix command is no longer required.

== OPTIONS

=== kcroninit

*-s*::
  Shared account mode. Use the cron principal itself (+username/cron/host.domain@REALM+) as the admin principal for keytab extraction. This is intended for shared accounts that do not have their own Kerberos principal. The Service Desk should have already created the cron principal before using this option.

*-h*::
  Display usage information and exit.

=== kcrondestroy

Accepts no arguments beyond the standard configuration.

== CONFIGURATION

Both utilities read configuration from the following locations (in order):

**/etc/sysconfig/kcron**::
  System-wide configuration file containing shell variable definitions.

**~/.config/kcron**::
  Per-user configuration file. Values here override system-wide settings.

Configuration variables (sourced from these files):

**WHOAMI**::
  Username for the cron principal (defaults to current user).

**NODENAME**::
  Fully qualified domain name for the host.

**REALM**::
  Kerberos realm.

**FULLPRINCIPAL**::
  Complete principal name in the form +username/cron/host.domain@REALM+.

**KEYTAB_INIT**::
  Path to the keytab initialization utility (default: +/usr/libexec/kcron/init-kcron-keytab+).

**KEYTAB_NAME_UTIL**::
  Path to the keytab name utility (default: +/usr/libexec/kcron/client-keytab-name+).

== EXAMPLES

Basic usage for regular user accounts:

----
$ kcroninit
kcroninit creates principal user/cron/host.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM and/or extracts its keys into a keytab.
This principal is used by the kcron utility for authentication.
You need to know the password for the 'user' user to continue.
Do you want to continue? (y/n)y
----

Usage for shared accounts (service accounts without personal principals):

----
$ kcroninit -s
----

Destroying a cron principal and keytab:

----
$ kcrondestroy
WARNING!!!
kcrondestroy WILL REMOVE principal user/cron/host.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM from Kerberos realm EXAMPLE.COM
and DELETE keytab /var/kerberos/krb5/user/1000/client.keytab.
This principal is used by the kcron utility for authentication.

Do you want to continue? (y/n)y
----

== LIMITATIONS

The kcron helper utilities utilize filesystem capabilities(7) stored as xattr(7) values on the binaries.  The application will not run as expected if your system does not support them.

On modern Linux systems, these are enabled by default.

NFS does not support capabilities(7) nor should it.  However, if you set this SUID 'root', it will continue to work as expected.  It is a terrible idea to permit SUID applications to run SUID from network file systems.

You can review them with getcap(8) on /usr/libexec/kcron/*

The kcron helper utilities assume basic kerberos utilities are installed and configured on the system:

* krb5.conf(5)
* kinit(1)
* kdestroy(1)
* kadmin(1)
* klist(1)

== EXIT STATUS

*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure (usage error; configuration error; unexpected error).

*2*::
  Failure (missing utilities; insufficient permissions).

== FILES

**/var/kerberos/krb5/user/${EUID}/client.keytab**::
  Default location for the automatically-used keytab file.

**/etc/sysconfig/kcron**::
  System-wide configuration file.

**~/.config/kcron**::
  Per-user configuration file.

**~/.k5identity**::
  Optional file to specify which principal from the keytab should be used for automatic authentication.

== NOTES

The use of this utility requires changes to KDC configuration. Kerberos admins should review the README file for the details.

Recent versions of kerberos (MIT 1.11+, Heimdal 8+) are able to automatically kinit against

+/var/kerberos/krb5/user/${EUID}/client.keytab+

if you do not have a valid Kerberos ticket.

By default this behavior uses +~/.k5identity+ if users have this file.  If not the first principle found within the keytab (ktutil(1) slot 0, kinit(1) rules for kinit -kt).
