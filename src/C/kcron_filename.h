 *   keytab_filename: Output buffer for the keytab filename

 *
 * All buffers must be at least FILE_PATH_MAX_LENGTH +3 bytes.
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, exits on failure
 *
 * Security Note: Uses UID instead of username to avoid TOCTOU issues
 * and username lookup failures. UIDs are immutable during process lifetime.
